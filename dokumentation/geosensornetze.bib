Abstract. Over the past decade we have witnessed the evolution of
wireless sensor networks, with advancements in hardware design, communication
protocols, resource efficiency, and other aspects. Recently,
there has been much focus on mobile sensor networks, and we have even
seen the development of small-profile sensing devices that are able to
control their own movement. Although it has been shown that mobility
alleviates several issues relating to sensor network coverage and connectivity,
many challenges remain. Among these, the need for position estimation
is perhaps the most important. Not only is localization required
to understand sensor data in a spatial context, but also for navigation,
a key feature of mobile sensors. In this paper, we present a survey on
localization methods for mobile wireless sensor networks. We provide
taxonomies for mobile wireless sensors and localization, including common
architectures, measurement techniques, and localization algorithms.
We conclude with a description of real-world mobile sensor applications
that require position estimation.},
